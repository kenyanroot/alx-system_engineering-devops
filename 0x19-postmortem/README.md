Postmortem: Unexpected Outage Due to Memory Leak in Web Application
Issue Summary
Duration of the Outage: The outage lasted for approximately 2 hours, starting at 3:00 PM and ending at 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on April 10, 2024.
Impact: During this period, the main web application experienced severe performance degradation, leading to timeouts and slow page loads. Roughly 65% of our user base experienced delays or could not access certain features of the service.
Root Cause: A memory leak within the web application's new feature deployment led to excessive consumption of server resources, causing system instability and service impairment.
Timeline
3:00 PM EDT - Monitoring tools triggered an alert indicating unusual memory usage on the web application servers.
3:05 PM EDT - The engineering team was notified about the issue. Initial assumptions pointed towards a spike in user traffic or a DDoS attack.
3:20 PM EDT - Traffic analysis disproved the DDoS hypothesis. The team started investigating recent changes to the application codebase.
3:40 PM EDT - A significant increase in customer support tickets was noticed, highlighting user difficulties with the web application.
4:00 PM EDT - Investigation revealed that the memory leak was associated with a recently deployed feature. The team began rolling back the update.
4:30 PM EDT - Several paths, including server configuration and external service dependencies, were investigated but later deemed unrelated to the issue.
4:50 PM EDT - The rollback was completed. System stability began to improve gradually.
5:00 PM EDT - Monitoring confirmed the return to normal operation. The incident was declared resolved.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: A newly introduced feature contained a memory leak due to improper memory management and object disposal within the application code. Over time, this flaw caused an accumulation of unused data in memory, leading to excessive resource consumption and eventual service degradation.
Resolution: The immediate solution involved rolling back the recent deployment to a stable version of the application. Subsequently, the problematic code was isolated, and a fix was applied to address the memory management issue.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent similar incidents in the future and improve our response, the following measures are proposed:
Code Review Enhancements: Introduce stricter code review processes focusing on resource management, especially for critical updates or new features.
Enhanced Monitoring: Implement more granular monitoring around memory usage and leaks. Set up alerts for anomalous patterns indicative of potential leaks.
Testing Improvements: Enhance testing procedures to include stress testing and memory leak detection in the staging environment before deployment.
Incident Response Training: Conduct regular incident response drills for the engineering team to improve the speed and efficiency of our response to unforeseen issues.
Specific Tasks:
Patch Web Application: Address the memory leak issue in the feature code and ensure the patch is thoroughly tested before redeployment.
Update Monitoring Tools: Configure additional alerts specifically for memory leak patterns and abnormal resource consumption.
Documentation: Update the engineering handbook to include guidelines on identifying and resolving memory leaks.
Post-Deployment Checks: Establish a protocol for post-deployment health checks to quickly identify and mitigate unintended side effects of new releases.
